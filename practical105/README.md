# Readme for practical 5

Contains three programs 'UserInput.c', 'Fibonacci.c' and 'Arctan.c'. 
The first shows an example of how to get inputs from the user. 
The second shows an implementation of the Fibonacci sequence taking the length of the sequence from the user.
The third contains an implementation of the Maclaurin series approximating the Arctan function.
